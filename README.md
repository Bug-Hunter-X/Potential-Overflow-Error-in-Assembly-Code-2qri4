# Potential Overflow Error in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential overflow error in a sample assembly code snippet.  The addition of `CX` to `AX` may result in an overflow if `CX` holds a large value, leading to incorrect program behavior. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error using appropriate checks and handling of potential overflows.
